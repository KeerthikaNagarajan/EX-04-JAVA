## Ex-04:
## Java program to print the even numbers between 1-20
### AIM:
To write a java program to print the even numbers between 1-20.
### ALGORITHM:
1. Import required packages.
2. Declare main method with the signature "public static void main(String[] args)".
3. By using a for look we can print even numbers 
4. By initilizin i as 0 and i less than or equal to 20 and increment i
5. Display the output

### PROGRAM:
```java
public class Ex4
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("The even numbers between 1-20:");
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<=20;i++)
        {
            System.out.print(+i+"\t");
            i+= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

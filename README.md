## Ex-4
## Java program to print the even numbers between 1-20
### Aim:
To write a java program to print the even numbers between 1-20.
### Procedure:
* Import required packages.
* Declare main method with the signature "public static void main(String[] args)".
* By using a for look we can print even numbers 
* By initilizin i as 0 and i less than or equal to 20 and increment i
* Display the output

### Code:
```
public class Ex4
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("The even numbers between 1-20:");
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<=20;i++)
        {
            System.out.print(+i+"\t");
            i+= 1;
        }
    }
